    My name is Ali. My journey into travel and photography began in 2007, and since then, I’ve explored close to 50 countries—and counting! 
    What fuels my passion for travel is the thrill of living in the moment and creating memories that last a lifetime, especially through the 
    lens of my camera. Travel is also an excuse for me to learn about other cultures, and the history of places I visit.
