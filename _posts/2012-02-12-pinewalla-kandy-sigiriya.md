# Pinewalla, Kandy, Sigiriya

I left Negombo early to visit Pinewalla Elephant Orphanage, in my way to Kandy. After changing two buses, I arrived at the orphanage. The entrance ticket was very expensive, in the excuse of helping the "orphan" elephants (17 dollars for foreigners). But the place was not that much like an orphanage. There were many elephants of all sizes (more than 50 I think), and they had mahoots who would constantly ask money from the visitors. I think many of these elephants could be set free to live on their own, but then how would they make money from them? Anyways, the elephants were feeding and bathing in the river, and the peope could get close and touch them. I liked to see elephants, but in a more intimate situation with a caring mahoot. Elephants are very intelligent animals and if their mahoot treats them fine, they will behave very well. But this was more like a show. Anyhow, it was nice to see those giants upclose.In the afternoon, I carried on to Kandy. I had reserved a room the day before in a guesthouse recommendee by the lonely planet (Mdme. Clement). The guesthouse was actually Madame Clement's house. She is a lovely old woman who speaks English very well. She had a big german shephard called Niki, who barked at me once I was entering the house that I got really scared if he is gonna attack me. But he was really a nice dog. I stayed two nights at Mdme Clement's and it was one of the best stays I've had during my trips. It was more like staying in a house than in a guesthouse.The next day, I headed out of Kandy to walk in the countryside. I walked between three temple located in the south-west of Kandy. It was a very pleasant walk, and the people I encountered were very nice. One invited me to rest a bit in his house, the other invited me for a tea, and everyone was saying hello with a big smile when passing by.The day after, I left kandy for Sigiriya. Sigiriya was the first photo I saw from Sri Lanka; a huge rock formed like a cylinder erected out of lush green plains around it. There was once a palace on top of it, but it's nothing but ruins now. I arrived there at noon, and put my luggage in a guesthouse closeby, and headed out to visit Sigiriya. I arrived at the entrance on the south, but then I found out that the actual entrance is stupidly located on the west side, and you have to walk a milometer or so to reach it. But what really pissed me off, was the flagrant entrance fee: 30 dollars! And you know how much you pay if you are Sri Lankan? A mere 50 rps, or 50 cents! This is absolutely ridiculous! For Taj Mahal, the most famous building in the world, you have to pay 15 dollars and I was even ranting about it! Now for this boring ruins on top of that admittedly magnificent rock formation (which Sri Lankan can take no credit for making it) you have to pay twice the Taj's fee! I then knew for other important landmarks of Sri Lanka, the foreign tourists have to pay similar fees. I decided to not visit any of them! This is shear milking the tourists, and it's not nice at all.Anyways, I went up the stairs to the top of Sigiriya, which took almost an hour. Midway up, there were some frescos of some half-naked women, but not so interesting after all (and definitely not as gorgeous and as old as the ones I saw in Ajanta Caves in India that they are compared with). The ruins are nothing special  in fact, just the base of the walls has remained and nothig else. The view from the top was very good though, and I spent an hour or so over there resting. I spent the night in Sigiriya, and the next day I headed to Trincomalee.Side notes:- Here, the first two seats of all buses are reserved for the clergy!- The buses here go super slow when they are not full. It pisses me off!- None of the banks in Sri Lanka change Indian Rupee! I had some left from my trip and I finally changed it in a jewellery.- The first three questions you are asked in Sri Lanka: 1) where do you come from? 2) how old are you? 3) are you married? Why not?- My conversation with a muslim shopkeeper after he finds out I'm Muslim: (him) are you married? (me) no. (him) have you come with your boyfriend? (me thinking he has made a mistake, as his English was not good) you mean girlfriend? (him) no, no, we muslims no girlfriend! (me shocked and laughing) sir, if you have a boyfriend and you are a guy, it means you're gay! (he didn't get it. also laughing!).
