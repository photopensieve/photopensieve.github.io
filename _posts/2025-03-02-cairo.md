# Cairo: Gateway to Ancient Wonders

Cairo stands as the magnificent gateway to Egypt's pyramids and ancient wonders. This sprawling megacity of 22 million inhabitants is characterized by high-density buildings and roads teeming with both cars and people. For most tourists, Cairo serves as the primary point of entry into Egypt, but it can be overwhelming at first—chaotic, confusing, occasionally aggravating, and undeniably intimidating. However, beneath this initial impression lies a city rich with history, culture, and unforgettable experiences.

## Is Egypt/Cairo Safe?

Let's address the elephant in the room: is Egypt—particularly Cairo—safe for tourists? And do you need a guide or tour company to plan your trip?

If you research travel experiences in Egypt on platforms like Reddit or YouTube, you'll encounter a deluge of warnings about touts, scammers, and the perils of traveling there, especially in Cairo and specifically around the Pyramids of Giza. The prevalence of these cautionary tales has led many potential visitors to seek tour guides or companies to safeguard them from these perceived dangers. Before my trip, I read so many concerning accounts that I worried this would be an extraordinarily difficult journey—some Reddit users even claimed it would be more challenging than traveling in India.

Despite these warnings, I trusted my instinct that these negative accounts might be overrepresented. I decided to forego tours and guides, opting to navigate Egypt independently. I'm happy to report that our experience was largely positive:

In Khan al-Khalili and other shopping areas, we didn't encounter any pushy sellers trying to force us into their shops. While they would certainly invite us in, a simple "Shokran" (thank you) as we continued walking was sufficient to end the interaction. Similarly, at tourist sites like the Pyramids of Giza, service providers offering camel rides would approach us, but respected our decline without persistent following or pressure. Throughout our stay, Egyptian people were remarkably friendly and welcoming, often expressing genuine delight at our visit to their country.

We experienced only one scam attempt, when an Uber driver asked us to cancel the ride and pay in cash, then demanded a higher price after we canceled—a situation we resolved by refusing and exiting the vehicle. Even this minor incident could have been avoided had we selected the cash payment option in the app initially.

This isn't to say that touts and scammers don't exist in Egyptian tourist areas—they certainly do—but I believe their prevalence and the severity of the issue are significantly exaggerated. When traveling anywhere new, it's always wise to research common scams and develop strategies to handle them. For instance, if you plan to take a camel ride at the pyramids, reading up on negotiation tactics beforehand is advisable. We personally opted against camel riding altogether.

Several factors might explain the contrast between our positive experience and the many negative accounts online:

We traveled as a family with a young child, which likely altered how locals approached us. In contrast, my wife once ventured out alone for a brief five-minute excursion and was surprised by the amount of catcalling and street comments she received—something that never occurred when we were together. While nothing aggressive happened, it certainly wasn't welcome. (The YouTube channel Gventures offers an informative video on this topic.)

In the pyramids area and Saqqara, we were accompanied by an Egyptian driver, which may have discouraged some potential harassers. Additionally, we physically resemble Egyptians, particularly myself, as evidenced by numerous people approaching me and speaking Arabic! If you appear distinctly non-Egyptian, your experience might differ, though this is merely a hypothesis.

## Arrival in Cairo

Our journey began with a Vueling flight from Paris Orly to Cairo, which proceeded smoothly. Upon arrival at the airport, we took the following steps:

First, we purchased Egyptian visas from bank counters in the pre-immigration area ($25 per person). This step is crucial for visa-on-arrival; without the visa sticker, you'll be turned away at immigration. Next, we withdrew Egyptian pounds from an ATM, passed through immigration, and bought Vodafone SIM cards in the arrival hall.

Having arranged our transfer in advance, reaching our hotel was straightforward. Contrary to my expectations, the taxi drivers outside the airport weren't particularly aggressive. The journey to Giza, near the pyramids, took about an hour due to heavy traffic. Our hotel, while not exceptional in itself, offered one of the most spectacular views of the pyramids available.

## Our Time in Cairo

We allocated four days to explore Cairo, which proved to be an ideal duration. Our itinerary consisted of three nights initially, followed by a trip to Luxor, and then another day in Cairo before departing. We chose to stay in Giza, though not in the immediate vicinity of the Pyramids like many accommodations in that area. Our hotel, Pyramids View Suites, offered what I consider the best view of the pyramids anywhere, making up for the merely adequate quality of the hotel itself.

## First Impressions of Cairo

Cairo is truly a mega-city with over 22 million inhabitants, making it one of the most densely populated places on Earth. Unlike Paris, which has undergone significant modernization and urban planning, Cairo has never experienced comprehensive remodeling or design processes. Consequently, it struggles with overwhelming traffic and pollution—perhaps among the worst of any major global city.

For transportation, Uber and Careem provide reliable and incredibly affordable options, though you might occasionally face longer wait times for ride acceptance. Crossing streets in Cairo presents a formidable challenge—I'd sometimes prefer taking an Uber to the other side rather than attempting to cross a major thoroughfare on foot!

One of our biggest surprises about Egypt was the omnipresence of security measures—checkpoints, metal detectors, and X-ray scanners are everywhere. As Persian speakers, we found the similarities between Persian and Arabic somewhat helpful but limited. While we share the same alphabet and Persian incorporates many Arabic words (roughly 20-30% by some estimates, though often with different meanings), spoken Egyptian Arabic remains largely incomprehensible to us.

We were pleasantly surprised to discover that Egyptians generally hold Iran in high regard, which prompted us to proactively mention our Iranian heritage in conversations. Given that such positive sentiment isn't universal, we appreciated and embraced this cultural connection.

## Tips for Traveling in Cairo

I strongly recommend avoiding traditional taxis to prevent potential pricing disputes. Instead, rely on ride-hailing services like Uber, Careem, or inDrive. While card payment is available, cash is preferable since these services typically pay drivers monthly, making drivers more inclined to accept cash-paying customers. We experienced difficulty securing rides until we switched to cash payments.

Arranging airport transfers through your hotel or booking platform (sometimes offered for free or discounted rates, as in our case) is highly advisable. Though potentially more expensive than Uber, it eliminates the stress of navigating transportation systems immediately upon arrival.

Understanding Egypt's tipping culture is essential before your visit (comprehensive resources are available online). Tipping is expected in Egypt, similar to the United States in certain contexts. However, the practice can create awkward interactions, as it becomes difficult to distinguish genuine kindness from service motivated by anticipated tips—an aspect of Egyptian tourism that we found somewhat off-putting.

The vast majority of Egyptians are wonderful, friendly, kind, and helpful individuals. Only a minority will attempt to take advantage of tourists. You can protect yourself by researching potential scams, learning standard price ranges, confirming which currency is being quoted, and clarifying whether prices apply to individuals or groups. My general travel principle for tourist-heavy destinations is: trust people you approach, but be cautious with those who approach you. With proper preparation, smart travel habits, and realistic expectations, you can mitigate negative experiences. Don't let online horror stories dissuade you from visiting.

## Pyramids of Giza

The eternal question of how ancient Egyptians constructed these monumental structures inevitably captures the imagination of every visitor. Various theories—most involving ramps—attempt to explain their construction methods, but none are fully conclusive or definitively proven. It's truly mind-boggling that structures built 4,700 years ago continue to puzzle "modern" humans regarding their construction techniques.

Did the pyramids meet my expectations? Both yes and no. Viewing them from a distance, with modern buildings providing scale perspective, was genuinely awe-inspiring—their immense size was breathtaking. This is why I particularly valued the view from our hotel room. However, up close, I must admit that the pyramids didn't evoke the same level of wonder, as their true magnitude became harder to fully comprehend.

I chose to enter Khufu's Pyramid, the most popular and expensive one to access. This experience isn't suitable for everyone, particularly those with claustrophobia, knee problems, or above-average height. While the interior offers limited sights, I appreciated seeing the Grand Gallery up close. Its purpose remains uncertain, though some theories suggest it facilitated the transport of massive granite stones—a hypothesis that seemed more plausible after witnessing it firsthand.

Ultimately, the pyramids represent humanity's primary motivation for visiting Egypt, and justifiably so. They stand as remarkable testaments to human ingenuity from a time so remote it challenges our imagination.

## Saqqara

Saqqara served as an ancient burial ground for thousands of years, resulting in an extraordinary concentration of tombs throughout the area. Located south of Cairo, it's best explored with a dedicated driver rather than Uber, as securing return transportation might prove challenging. Additionally, the site's expansive nature makes driving between locations more practical.

We visited the Step Pyramid, humanity's first pyramid, along with numerous tombs throughout the complex. However, I should note that these tombs, while impressive, don't quite match the splendor of those in Luxor (a topic I'll address in my next post).

## Other Notable Places to Visit in Cairo

### Egyptian Museum in Cairo

This museum currently qualifies as a must-visit attraction, housing several crucial artifacts including Tutankhamun's funerary mask and sarcophagus—truly remarkable treasures to behold. I emphasize "currently" because Tutankhamun's artifacts will eventually relocate to the Grand Egyptian Museum, at which point the GEM will become the essential museum experience.

Extremely popular with tourists, the museum can become quite crowded, particularly in the morning. We initially considered returning earlier another day but discovered that midday or afternoon visits offer a less congested experience. Beyond Tutankhamun's treasures, the museum displays important statues, several mummies, and numerous funerary sarcophagi.

Touring with a guide might enhance your visit, especially without prior research into ancient Egyptian history—otherwise, much of the significance may be lost. Having conducted our research beforehand, we opted against hiring a guide and felt our experience remained comprehensive.

### Grand Egyptian Museum

Constructed at a staggering cost of $1.2 billion, this museum has yet to fully open. Complete inauguration is anticipated by mid-2025. Currently missing are Tutankhamun's tomb items (awaiting transfer from the Egyptian Museum) and the 44-meter-long, 4,700-year-old wooden Khufu's ship—an artifact I particularly hoped to see but remains unavailable for viewing.

While we did visit this massive and architecturally striking building, I believe the expensive entrance fee isn't currently justified given the incomplete exhibits.

### Islamic Cairo

This area pulsates with life—vibrant, chaotic, and energetic. Khan al-Khalili bazaar exemplifies this dynamism, offering rich opportunities for street photography. However, navigating this bustling environment requires constant vigilance, especially when supervising children amidst the chaos.

Despite warnings about the overwhelming crowds and aggressive vendors in Khan al-Khalili, we encountered no problems whatsoever. We also visited Al-Azhar Mosque, though in retrospect, this could probably be omitted from your itinerary.

### Cairo Citadel

Also known as Saladin Citadel, this fortress was established by Saladin in the 12th century. Within its walls stands the beautiful Ottoman-era Muhammad-Ali Mosque, which absolutely warrants a visit.

## FAQ

### How is traveling in Egypt with a young kid?

Our son, nearly four years old, previously showed little interest in ancient sites during our visit to Persepolis, which complicated that experience. We anticipated similar challenges in Egypt but were pleasantly surprised by his cooperation as he accompanied us through the ancient ruins. Of course, maintaining his engagement required creative approaches—finding ducks in hieroglyphs, sharing stories about a boy named Imhotep (who was actually the architect of the Step Pyramid!), or explaining why a mummy hadn't brushed his teeth! Fortunately, he's managed to enjoy himself throughout the journey.

Regarding safety precautions for young children, we avoid tap water, uncooked salads, exposed fruits, and maintain constant supervision. While we brought a safety vest for our son, we eventually abandoned it due to the lack of seatbelts or functioning buckles in many Egyptian vehicles.

### How does Egypt/Cairo compare to India in terms of travel difficulty?

Having explored both countries, I would classify them as nearly equivalent in difficulty, though if pressed to choose, I'd say Egypt presents slightly fewer challenges: Egypt is generally cleaner (with fewer animals roaming the streets), can be less crowded and chaotic (outside certain Cairo areas), and exhibits less extreme poverty than India. Regarding scams, both countries seem comparable, with tourist areas in both places harboring numerous scammers. In terms of frustrations, both countries can be equally trying—activities like booking train tickets online or navigating local websites often become nightmarish experiences, leaving visitors wondering why straightforward design solutions haven't been implemented.

I would note that Indians generally seem marginally friendlier than Egyptians, though the difference isn't substantial. Additionally, Egypt's tipping culture sometimes creates uncomfortable dynamics, fostering the impression that assistance is motivated primarily by anticipated tips—though this isn't necessarily accurate.

Despite these challenges, I thoroughly enjoyed visiting both countries and created incredible memories in each. In fact, part of the adventure of traveling in these destinations involves navigating the very difficulties they present!
