# How my camera changed my travel experience!

Recently, a friend of mine went through my Flickr photostream, and told me that I am gradually drifting from landscape photography to people photography. It is very true.Â Not that I don't like landscapes anymore, but now I find people to be more beautiful. It is kind of weird to say, but photography eases up talking and befriending with strangers. Through photography, you can learn about their lives, their attitudes, their jobs, and capture them. So in a way, my camera is helping me to communicate more with the people. Take [my experience in Khuri](http://photopensieve.blogspot.com/2011/10/khuri-tranquil-stay-in-authentic.html) for instance:

Over there, I met these women carrying pots of water on top of their heads. If I didn't have my camera, I would just take a look and go back to my guesthouse. But since I wanted to take their photos, I had to communicate with them (with no English!), make them laugh and get friendly with them, and take their photos. But more importantly, by doing that, I had so much fun that this experience became one of my best memories of the trip! Almost every photo I made have such a story. In a way, I owe most of the experiences I had with the locals to my desire to photograph them! So my camera is not merely a tool to capture photos, but "an excuse" and "a reason" to go and mingle with the locals. Weird, eh?
