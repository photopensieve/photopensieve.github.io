The trip was quite tiresome, as there was 8 hours waiting time between the two flights and I arrived at 3h30 AM in Cochin airport. Initially I wanted to spend a day in Cochin itself to get some sleep and restore my energy. But in the end, I decided to go directly to Alleppey, where I wanted to visit the backwaters. When I was getting out of the airport, I was expecting to confront with a swarm of taxi/rickshaw drivers, like elsewhere in India. But to my surprise, not even a single one asked me. I thought I'm well disguised as an Indian and I fooled them! But it turned out that there were no such taxi drivers there. There were only pre-paid taxis, and that was it. I got a taxi for the central bus station in Cochin, where I could get a local bus to Alleppey. The road between the airport and the city was surprisingly good, compared to the north and west of India that I had visited last year. All in all, the first experience of the South was quite a bit different than I thought!<br />I took the bus to Alleppey, and arrived there around 8 AM. Being so tired and sleepy, I still had another thing to do: finding a room. I hadn't booked a room, and I had to look around to find one. After a long search, I managed to find a room in a nice guesthouse, thanks to the help of a local guy who took me there with his bike. I then ventured out to eat something and I found a local place serving Keralan brealfast.<br />So a word on the Keralan breakfast (look at the photo). The white bread like thing is made out if rice, and the thing on top is a mix of onion and some spices, plus an egg. So what's the catch? it's BLOODY spicey! What is bloody spicey? It's when your breath is exuding fire, your lips are painfully swollen, your nose is running, your eyes seem bursting into tear, and even your stomach keeps feeling its hotness long after finishing it. Obviously for them, this is only a little bit spicey (I asked!). Oh, and if you think tea or water can quench that fire in you, you're wrong.<br />As I said before, Alleppey is famous for it's backwaters, i.e. a network of water canals and lakes meandering through land. Something like Venice, but in a larger scale. The land is largely reclaimed from water and made into paddy fields. The houses are usually built beside the canals to benefit from the water. You see people bathing in it, washing their clothes and dishes, kids playing in it, and obviously using it as a means of transport. This calm refreshing spot have not gone unnoticed by the foreign and Indian tourists, and there are loads of them here in the dry season (now). The locals have taken full advantage of this opportunity, by transforming their boats into houseboats and asking a fortune for overnight stays. There are way too many of them and though good-looking, they are harmful to the environment.<br />During my stay in Alleppey, I did a lot of backewaters, either with Shikaras (private boats), or government boats. No need to rent a Shikara, I would say, government boats go almost everywhere. The boat ride is very relaxing and full of beautiful sights, and goes right beside where people live. I also did walk around the canals, where possible, and took some photos. My next destination was Kumily. <p>Side notes:<p>- The men here wear long loincloths, wearing it in different ways around their waist. The women dangle strings of white flowers from their long sleek hairs. <br />- This time, I am not reserving hotels in advance. I just go to the place and look around. I look in my guidebooks (I have both the Lonely Planet, and the Rough Guide), but I found the suggested hotels to be more expensive than the competition. We'll see how it goes in future.<br />- I am very careful to not be bitten by mosquitoes here, applying insect repellent when necessary and checking if all the doors and orifices are closed when I want to sleep. My foot was bitten some day ago and it is now still swollen and painful!<br />- Kerala is a communist state, and you can see pictures of Stalin, Lenin, and Che everywhere! But apparently, the local authorities are doing good. The literacy rate is almost 100% here!
