In [September 2023](https://photopensieve.github.io/2023/09/15/our-dream-travel-around-world-begins.html), we (a family of three) embarked on a nine-month-long round-the-world journey, visiting 15 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Summarizing such an extensive trip in a single blog post is impossible, but I’ll give it a try to help myself process it all. This might not make perfect sense to others since it’s just a bunch of bullet points with little explanations, but if you’re curious, you can check the individual blog posts for more details and my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/photopensieve/) for the photos.

## What wasn’t so good?

Surprisingly, just a few things come to mind, and even those were minor anyways:

* Bus attendants in Greece who were sometimes a bit too curt and aggressive
* A few of our stays like the ones in Taipei, Raiatea, and Hambourg
* Our tense flight connection from Taipei to Siem Reap with Vietjet.

This trip was our dream for the longest time, and we are enormously fortunate and proud to finally make it happen. **You live once, and only once, so if you have a dream, chase it!** You won’t regret it.
