As usual, I took the bus from Munnar to Madurai. In middle of the way, the bus stopped for lunch in some nowhere. I was quite hungry, so I went into the only &quot;restaurant&quot; over there, one of those beside the road types of restaurents. When I sat, the guy put a &quot;banana leaf&quot; and a glass of hot water in front of me. I was not quite sure what I am supposed to do with it, till I saw the guy on the other table showing me how to do it. Basically, I had to open the banana leaf, and wash the inner side with the water, and that would serve as the plate! After doing that, the guy came and put some rice on my &quot;plate&quot;, poured some &quot;dhal&quot; on it and then put two kinds of vegetable stew beside it. The taste was good and I even had a second helping. The vegetarian food in South India is very rich and delicious, tempting me to become vegetarian... kidding! And guess how much I paid for that? 35 rps, equal to 0.7 dollars!<br />I arrived in Madurai without having a room reserved. This time, I encountered some difficulties. Most of the hotels were full, and some were asking for ridiculous prices. I finally found a room with a reasonable price, but of modest quality. It was already late to go to the temple, and I was too tired and hungry, so I set out to find a good restaurent to eat. I found a pure vegetarian restaurent which served delicious local foods. I had a two-course dinner there: Idli and Chutney in one course, and Masala Dosa in another. Yummy!<br />Next day in the morning, I went to the temple. The architecture of temples in the South is totally different from those in the North. From what I have found out, temples in the South play a more important role in the everyday life of the city/town/village than those in the North. Many of the South Indian cities are formed around a temple, which are very much alive, and the ancient traditions are still performed on a daily basis. There are constant activities going on everyday: dancing, singing, music, pujas (offerings), festivals and feasts. As an example, everyday the gods (as statues) are waken up and brought out from one area of the temple to the other by special rituals, and at night, they are put back to sleep with some other rituals. During the day, they are offered food several times, and countless other times by the pilgrims. The offerings are normally fruits, food, and sweets. This is apart from the monetary contributions which are done in numerous occasions, and for different reasons. This makes some of the South Indian temples to be among the richest religious institutions on earth!<br />Sri Meenakshi Temple is considered the height of South Indian architecture. It is a big complex containing 12 Gopurams (gateway towers), several dedicated temples inside (including a Shiva temple), with not less than 33,000 statues. The tallest Gopuram is as high as 52m and all are carved with staggering arrays of colorful gods, demons and heros. Inside the temple complex, there are thousands of pillars, some elaboratingly carved into shapes of gods. The architecture of the temple by itself is a compelling reason for visiting it, but watching the crowd performing numerous religious rituals is the cherry on the top. However, much of the complex, i.e. its heart, is closed to non-hindus. So I was going around in the temple, and following the crowd, I entered one of this prohibited areas, the Shiva Temple. I didn't notice that until I saw some foreigners being kicked out by the guards. I was doing a queue to go to the inner part of the temple, and I thought they soon will spot me and kick me out too. But to my surprise, they didn't noitice that I'm not Indian! I went in mimicking the crowd in front of me, and doing the same rituals as them to blend in! And it worked. The inner sanctum is a level of magnitude more elaborate than the outer ring. There are impressive statues in gold, silver and bronze, and the atmosphere is more compelling. I then wanted to enter another prohibited area, but they noticed me and didn't let me in. So in the afternoon I came back with a cunning plan! I left my camera bag in the hotel (last time I was in India, a guy in Pushkar said this bag makes me so not-Indian!), and when in the temple, I put a red mark on my forehead (got the dye from a statue of a beaky god that I don't know the name), and even tried to put the three white lines that some make on their forehead using some powder that was put in my hand by a priest (it didn't look good at the end!). I later found out that this was a sign of Shivites, Devotees of Shiva. This way there was no way that they could tell me from an Indian (obviously this method is not going to work for a blond Swedish!). I went back in the prohibited temples and walked around freely. However I did not get into all temples, as for some there was long queues. Looking like an Indian is definitely advantageous in India! When I came out of the temple and went into the shops outside, the people were speaking in Tamil with me, and when they saw that I speak English, they switched to Hindi, thinking that I'm from the North!<br />The next day, I went on to my next destination, Trichy. The road condition between Madurai and Trichy was very good, and for the first time in India, I saw proper highway! However, the speed was always below 80 km/hr. I found a room close to the bus station with lots of difficulties, as most of the hotels were full. Apparently, the day was an auspicious day and there were lots of weddings going on in the city.<p>Side notes:<p>- It's very difficult to find wifi here. I have go hunting outside shops and hotels to find one!<br />- It seems like Tamil people like the idea of chubby men with moustache. At least some of their movie stars are like that!<br />- It seems to me that the women in the South are socially stronger than the northern women, perhaps due to the matriarchy system inherited from the early Dravidians, compared to the patriarchy system in the North inherited from the indo-europeans. For instance, unlike the northern women who sometimes cover their faces with their transparent scarves, the southern women do not cover their faces. Or in the bus, they easily ask the men to relinquish their seats to them.
