So after a grueling 23h flight and layover, we got to Delhi around 1:30 AM. The immigration took a long 1h30 (at least we got our e-visa in less than 24h!), and it took us some time and a few phone calls to find our ride to the hotel. The hotel looked nice in the photos, but the room was musty and damp. Per Murphy's law, we then didn't have hot water to shower. Oh well. First day is always the best... After finally having our hot water issue fixed and having breakfast, we headed out to Old Delhi, having haggling with the tuk tuk driver, per usual. We visited Red Fort, which was a must-see. We then walked around in the bazaar, with its narrow overcrowded streets, and motorbikes zigzaging their way through by their loud constant honks. I can't say that I enjoyed walking around the old bazaar. We then found the famous Jama Masjid, but when we wanted to enter, some touts harassed us that you can't enter with camera or phone, and you need to pay. It was outrageous, because we knew they were scams. Anyhow, we had to go in separately, while the other one stayed out with the cameras. The mosque itself was very pretty, but this experience soured the whole thing for us. We spent the rest of the day exploring Jantar Mantar, and an old stepwell. We then headed back to the hotel and picked up our bags to leave for the train station to take our overnight ride to Pushkar.Last time I came to India, it was 7 years ago, but not much has changed really, and it all came back to me in an instant: The noises, the smells and the hustle and bustle in the streets. India hasn't changed, but I have. Not sure I would enjoy it as much as I did last time. Or maybe this is just the first-day shock, and I need time to adjust. Whatever it is, I don't recommend Delhi as the first place to visit when arriving in India. Also, last time I enjoyed India greatly because I was doing a lot of people photography, through which I met so many great people, and wonderful experiences. My inner photographer hasn't warmed up yet, so hopefully it does soon!Notes1. In Seattle airport, we got an offer to fly the next day for \$800 of cashback each, but by the time we decided, the offer was gone. :/2. Lufthansa has horrible food... I mean even their scrambled eggs tasted like sawdust. I don't know... is it a German thing?!?3. We used Delhi's metro system as much as we could. It is crowded, but it is dependable and safe, at least.
