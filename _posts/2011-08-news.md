So it's official! I will have two photo trips soon. A week long trip to northwest of Iran, visiting beautiful villages, cities and do some landscape photography. The highlights of the trip will be visiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masouleh">Masouleh</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabriz">Tabriz</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alishokri/3745617489/">Colored Mountains</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Urmia">lake Urmia</a>. Very photogenic places and great for landscape photography!<br />
<br />
The second destination is one of my dream trips: India! I will be backpacking for the first time in India for a month. I am immensely thrilled about it! Just imagine all the possibilities for photography... people, colors, landscape, architecture and chaotic but live cities. There is so much to see in India that a six month tourist visa is barely enough, let alone a month! So I have to handpick a few places.&nbsp;I still haven't settled down with a plan, but I definitely want to visit Delhi, Agra, Varanasi, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh.<br />

I will be posting about my travel plans, my packing, camera gear that I bring with me and eventually blog about my travel here! So make sure to subscribe to the feed, if you use a RSS reader, or follow me by email (you find them both on the right pane).
