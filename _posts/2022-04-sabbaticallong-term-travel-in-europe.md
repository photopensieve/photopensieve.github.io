We don't have set plans for what comes next, but possibly we'll continue to Croatia, and more. Oh, and we're going to do that with a one-year-old!</font></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">Well, a lot has happened in the last couple of years. Apart from the elephant in the room, COVID, and with all the curveballs it has thrown at the world, we had a baby in March 2021, and our lives have changed beyond what we had imagined. Gone are the days of traveling around the world... or so everyone was telling us! Little did they know that if you're bitten by the travel bug, there is no cure. It is of course quite challenging to travel with a toddler - and we are going to learn that the hard way - but I like to think that with some planning, flexibility, and lowering the expectations, it should be doable, and even daresay, enjoyable! We're going to test that hypothesis, and I'm going to report back here.</font></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">Since there is a lot to cover, I'm going to write the rest of this post in FAQ fashion - as a true Amazonian - so it is more readable.</font></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">FAQ</font></h3><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">Why are you doing this?</font></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">We haven't "properly" traveled for the past 2 years. Well, technically we have traveled: A few trips in mainland US/Canada, and a visit back home. The main culprit has been of course COVID, but we also couldn't travel much with a newborn. We were planning for a long trip right before the pandemic hit, so had to postpone it. Now with COVID at bay (for now), and our baby being more mobile and manageable, we finally decided to get back to traveling.</font></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">How long are you traveling?</font></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">We have a date by which we need to be back, but we may come back earlier, based on how things go. I’m not gonna say it here and jinx it though.</font></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">Why do you travel in the first place?</font></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">If you asked me this question some time ago, I would have said because I like photography. But now, I think I have found a more profound reason: I work a 9-5 job, 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year (minus vacation). If you ask me what I did in a given two-week period in the past year, I can hardly remember anything. It's all a blend: meetings, meetings, and more meetings. But when I travel for two weeks, I remember every single day of it. I reasonably remember what I did, what I saw, what happened, and there are photos (and blog posts!) to refresh my memory, when needed. I believe one reason that people tend to think that "time flies" is living a mundane life for too long. Day-in, day-out, doing the same thing over and over, and looking back and remembering nothing makes you think that time has passed fast. So I travel to cease the moment, to lengthen my (perception of) life, and to create memories to look back at.<br /></font></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">Why not wait until your baby is older?</font></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">There is no question that traveling with a 1-year-old comes with a <a href="https://www.ytravelblog.com/worst-age-travel-with-kids/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">whole slew of challenges</a>: For one, you should be constantly watching a one-year-old, as their primary goal seems to be discovering new ways to hurt themselves. On top of that, there is sleep problems, stroller, baby carrier, diapers, baby food, crying, and all other things that will naturally get resolved with time. So this question makes complete sense.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">But believing that future will solve all problems, or future will be easier and more suitable is a fallacy that we often fall into. We think that the future holds better. We see our problems disappear in future. And they will, but at the same time, there will be new ones altogether. Case in point: We conceived of the long-term travel idea as early as 2015. When I look back, I'm unsure why we didn't do it back then, when we didn't have a baby, nor there was a pandemic in the world. It would have been far easier than now. But we didn't, and the reason is exactly the "rosy future fallacy": We always thought future would be better for such travels. So long story short, <i>carpe diem</i>!</font></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">Why Europe? Haven't you lived there before?</font></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">My wife and I both lived in Europe for five years as students, during which we travelled a lot, and made great memories. We have always loved traveling in Europe, and although we have seen much of the touristy hotspots, we haven't scratched the surface when it comes to less touristy, but equally amazing places it has to offer. So this time, we are going to visit some of the more off-the-beaten-path destinations, and also revisit some of our favorite places.</font></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">Why don't you have an itinerary yet?</font></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">That’s the whole thrill of it! We have already secured transportation and accommodation for the first few weeks of the trip, and we have a rough idea what comes next, but we want to leave some room for spontaneity. We don't even have return tickets yet, as we don't know where we will end up. How awesome is that?&nbsp;</font></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">Enough with the philosophy, what camera gear are you taking with you?</font></h4><div style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial" size="4">Don't we all love obsessing over camera gear! I certainly do. But this trip is not all about photography. It's a family-first trip, and photography is a would-be-nice. However, this doesn't mean that I would skimp on photo preparation. Au contraire; I want to enjoy photography during the trip, but at the same time I need to optimize what gear to take, given that we will be carrying around our baby and the baby gear. I'll write another post detailing all the gear we will take with us, including camera gear.</font></div>
