# Jordan: A Hidden Gem in the Middle East

## Geography and History of Jordan

Nestled in the heart of the Middle East, Jordan is a fascinating country characterized by its unique geographical and political landscape. Geographically, it is one of the driest countries in the world, situated at the crossroads of Asia, Africa, and Europe. The country's terrain is predominantly desert, with rocky plateaus, mountain ranges, and the iconic Great Rift Valley cutting through its landscape.

Historically, Jordan's territory has been home to some of the oldest civilizations in the world. From the Nabataean Kingdom that built Petra to the Roman and Byzantine influences, the land has been a crucible of diverse cultures and civilizations. Its modern history began after World War I, with the establishment of the Emirate of Transjordan under British mandate, eventually gaining full independence in 1946.

Unlike most of its neighbors, Jordan does not have oil, which might be a downside, but could be an upside too. This lack of natural resources has forced the country to develop innovative economic strategies, investing heavily in human capital, education, and strategic international relationships.

The country has a unique position in the Middle East, playing a crucial humanitarian role by hosting many refugees from Palestine and Syria. This has been a defining characteristic of Jordan's modern identity, demonstrating remarkable resilience and compassion in a volatile region.

Jordan is known for its neutrality, alignment with the US, and progressive policies. While maintaining peace with Israel, Jordanian people heavily support Palestine, showcasing the country's nuanced approach to regional politics. The current monarch, King Abdullah II, is particularly well-liked both domestically and internationally, making Jordan seem like the cool dude in the neighborhood who is respected and admired by others.

## Logistics of Travel in Jordan

There are multiple places of interest in Jordan, from north to south:
- Jerash and Amman: The capital city and its nearby historical sites
- Dead Sea: The famous natural wonder
- Petra: The iconic archaeological site
- Wadi Rum: The stunning desert landscape
- Aqaba and Red Sea: The coastal region

Jordan has two major international airports: Amman and Aqaba, which provide convenient entry points. It is best to rent a car. Driving in Jordan was pretty easy, except maybe within Amman. 

The Jordan Pass is a tourist pass that covers entry to most archaeological sites, saving travelers money and hassle. We got a Zain SIM card from Aqaba which had 40 GB of data for around $18.

## Our Time in Jordan

We entered through Aqaba and exited from Amman airport, which was best, as we didn't have to drive back to the same airport. Our itinerary was as follows:
- A couple of nights in Aqaba
- Two nights in Wadi Rum
- One night in Petra
- Two nights in a Dead Sea resort
- Visited Jerash on the way to Amman
- Three nights in Amman

## First Impressions of Jordan

Arriving from the chaos of Cairo, Aqaba was such a contrast. It had a small airport, and the city was so quiet and comparatively empty. The Jordanian dinar is stronger than the dollar and is pegged at a ratio of 1:1.4.

Compared to Egypt, there are significantly fewer security measures, although you still see a lot of security forces and checkpoints on the roads. We loved Jordanian cuisine, especially their national dish, Mansaf (a traditional dish made of lamb cooked in a sauce of fermented dried yogurt and served with rice).

We were surprised by the few tourists we saw in Jordan in March. I think it was probably due to being Ramadan and the colder weather. I'm not complaining though.

Overall, we thought that Jordan is a gem of a travel destination and is well worth a visit. There is so much to do and see there for 7-10 days. Locals are friendly and nice, and we enjoyed our interactions with them. It is certainly one of the easier countries to travel in the Middle East.

## Aqaba

Aqaba is the only port city of Jordan. It is within sight of Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Egypt. You can do snorkeling and diving in the area.

We spent a whole day at a beach club called Berenice, and relaxed there, while our son played with sand to his heart's content. There were only a handful of tourists there, and we practically had the whole beach to ourselves.

I snorkeled a little bit around a pier and was amazed by how clear the water was. I saw a lot of corals and colorful fish around the pier. The water was a bit cold though.

## Wadi Rum

Wadi Rum has been made famous by several movies shot in its stunning landscape. It was on my bucket list for a long time, and I was super pumped about visiting it. I'm glad to report that it did not disappoint.

It has magical sunrises and sunsets. Make sure to wake up early and find a good spot for photography. The area is home to Bedouins, the traditional nomadic Arab people of the desert.

We drove to a meeting point after the village, and our host came over and picked us up in his 4x4. There are many camps in Wadi Rum. We chose to stay in a Bedouin camp. There are Martian-styled camps too, but we felt that those are not genuine.

We stayed there for two nights, which was a perfect amount of time for us. We did a full 4x4 day-tour, visiting multiple sights. We were accompanied by 4 other American tourists who, surprisingly, were living in Zambia. It was a fun day, and we enjoyed their company.

Wadi Rum is an amazing place for photography, with its stark landscapes and dramatic rock formations. It is such a quiet place. It is probably one of the most serene places I've ever visited. The quiet is deafening!

## Petra

Petra is the most famous tourist attraction in Jordan and is part of the 7 new wonders of the world. We stayed one night in Petra and spent half a day exploring the site.

We entered through the main gate and walked through the narrow canyon leading to the Treasury. The Treasury is what most people know as Petra, but there is a lot more to the archaeological site.

I loved taking pictures of the Treasury from different angles. There are always two camels sitting in front of it, so framing them into your photos is a must.

We were lucky that there were not that many tourists there, and at times I could have a clear shot of Treasury without any tourists in the frame. Petra can get pretty crowded in the high season, so I'm happy to experience it with a smaller crowd.

We walked all the way to the Roman Colonnade but did not hike up to the Monastery, as it would have been too long and would have required us to walk all the way back.

I think the best way to do it is to park your car at the main entrance (which has a free parking lot), then take a taxi to the other entrance, and walk from there to Monastery, and then just do a one-way walk to Treasury and back to the main gate through the Canyon.

One thing that we didn't enjoy as much at Petra were some persistent people trying to give us horse or donkey rides outside and especially inside Petra. But as usual, a polite, but firm "no thank you" should be sufficient to deter them.

Overall, Petra was definitely worth a visit, though the most photogenic part is the Treasury itself, and the rest of the site was just okay.

## Dead Sea

The Dead Sea is another must-visit destination in Jordan. Initially, I wanted to just spend a half-day there to just dip in the water and leave. But our Jordanian friend highly recommended spending some time at a resort at Dead Sea, so we decided to spend two nights there, relaxing and allowing our son to play around. This was the best idea ever!

Marriott Resort at Dead Sea was an excellent choice. We were lucky to have the resort to ourselves, as there were only a handful of other guests staying there during that time, so it was like having the resort to ourselves! The facilities were top-notch, and the hospitality and service was excellent. We specifically enjoyed dining twice at Oak Tree Restaurant in the resort, which had excellent cuisine and fantastic service. We were pleasantly surprised by how good it was.

Dipping in Dead Sea is a fascinating experience. Because of the high salinity of the water, the density of the water is [X]% higher than sea water, so you are a lot more buoyant. If I float vertically in a pool or sea, my head will be under the water if I don't move. But in Dead Sea, I was effortlessly almost up to my chest! We also recreated the famous floating and reading a book photo.

Having said that, something I didn't know is that in Dead Sea, it was a lot harder to stay afloat, because even though my head was above the water, I was not stable, and I could quickly flip over. That caused me to hit the rough rocks in the shallows a couple of times, and I got some scrapes and cuts that burned a lot. I washed them afterwards with clean water, but the cuts were pretty gnarly.

### Tip and tricks for dipping into the Dead Sea

- Bring water shoes, as the rocks are quite rough and have sharp edges
- Bring some bandaids and disinfectants just in case you get scrapes and cuts
- You certainly need to take a shower, or wash yourself with water afterwards. That's why staying at a resort is a good idea, since they have showers at their private beaches
- To access the water, you must find a right spot. Our resort, for example, had a winding way down to the water, but if you want to visit outside a resort, you must find a right spot beforehand. There are not that many places that you can access the water

## Jerash and Amman

We had a hard time saying goodbye to the Marriott Resort, but after two nights, it was time to hit the road again and go to Amman for our last three nights in Jordan. Along the way, we visited Jerash, an incredibly well-preserved Roman archaeological site.

We rested for one day and celebrated our son's birthday in the hotel. Sometimes you have to slow down and just have an off-day.

We were lucky that in Amman, we knew a local (brother of our Jordanian friend in Seattle), who showed us around and gave us the locals' perspective about living in Jordan. We were very thankful to him for giving us a tour of Amman.

We visited the Citadel, which was similar to Jerash, but much smaller and less well-preserved, and the Roman Theater. I must say that although Amman is the capital of Jordan, there is not much to do there for tourists, so it's not a must-visit place in Jordan if you are tight on time.

With this, our 9-day trip to Jordan came to an end, and we flew to Emirates for a short stay before heading to Iran to visit our families. Overall, I have to say that we loved Jordan, and we highly recommend it as a fantastic travel destination. Petra, Wadi Rum, Dead Sea, and Jerash are must-visit places, and Jordanians are warm and friendly. I can't say enough good things about our visit.

## FAQ

### How was visiting Jordan in Ramadan?

We arrived in Jordan the first day of Ramadan, so the whole time we were there, it was Ramadan. Ramadan is the holy month in the Islamic calendar when Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. Ramadan may not be the best time to visit many Muslim countries, Jordan being no exception, as most restaurants are closed for breakfast and lunch.

We had breakfasts at our hotels, so no issues there, but finding restaurants for lunch was a challenge. Case in point, in Petra, our hotel manager told us that there are no restaurants open for lunch, so we just got some canned food from a grocery store and had lunch in our room. But the upside is that there are probably fewer tourists during this time of the year, so if that's what you care about, maybe visiting during Ramadan is a great idea.

### How do Egypt and Jordan compare as tourist destinations?

Although Egypt and Jordan are (almost) neighbors, I have to say that they are quite different. Egypt has a much higher population density, especially in Cairo, so your experience will be quite different.

There is a lot more to visit in Egypt, of course. From the Pyramids to the temples and tombs of Luxor and Aswan, I don't think there is any other destination in the world that matches Egypt in terms of ancient archaeology and history. Period.

Jordan is much easier to travel in. You can rent a car and go around easily, but I do not recommend that in Egypt.

If you are an experienced traveler, you can travel in Egypt for much cheaper, but if you are not, and especially if you choose to have an arranged trip with tours and cruises, etc., Egypt can be much more expensive.

There is no tipping expectation in Jordan, so we found it much easier to interact with people.

### How is it that Jordan is such a stable country in the middle of one of the most unstable regions in the world?
