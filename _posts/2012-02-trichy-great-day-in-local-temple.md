The road condition between Madurai and Trichy was very good, and for the first time in India, I saw proper highway! However, the speed was always below 80 km/hr. I found a room close to the bus station with lots of difficulties, as most of the hotels were full. Apparently, the day was an auspicious day and there were lots of weddings going on in the city.<br />Next day I went to visit the Srirangam Temple which is the largest temple in India. It is so huge that it's more like a fortified town. However, beauty-wise it is not a match for the venerable Sri Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. Again this time, I disguised as a Hindu and went in the inner part of the temple, forbidden for non-Hindus. But then again there was this huge queue that I never ever could or would do to get in the heart of the temple. For me, what was more interesting than the architecture of this mighty temple was the temple's elephant. People would come forth and put money on the ending part of its trunk, and the elephant would grab it, and then raise its trunk and touch the bowed head of the person, as like it's blessing him/her! It would then give the money to its mahout. Elephant is one of my favorite animals, as it is very clever and mighty, but generally calm. I'm going to have more experience with elephants in Sri Lanka.<br />In the temple, I saw many people having their hair completely shaved. I asked around and found out that they have done it in another temple further away, called Samayapuram. Photographying the ritual shaving was in my top list for South India, so I decided to go to that temple in the afternoon. I took two buses to reach there. The temple was very alive with so many people (I then found out that this temple is in fact very popular, and the second richest temple in Tamil nadu). The people were mostly dressed in vivid yellow and some in red. Lots of crying and dancing was going on as well. All the people there, were pilgrimes, and I was the ONLY tourist over there (Indian and Non-Indian likewise), and my shear presence was raising a lot of attention. It took me a while to find out where they were doing the shaving job, as no one spoke a word of English. So people go there to donate their hair to the god (it's a local female god), in return of a favor. These hairs then end up in markets all over the US and Europe. The place was basically a large room with barbers sitting all around it, and people were doing a queue for each, having their tickets and razor blades in hand. People also bring their kids for the shave and they obviously don't like the idea, and usually start a crying feat when it's their turn. It is also notable that not only men, but also women come for the shave. This is quite something, as the South Indian women usually have very long hairs, and they take very good care of their hair, so losing it in a whiff should be very awkward for them.<br />When I took out my camera, the barbers said I'm not allowed to take photos there and I should go out. I asked around and found out that it is not really allowed (though nowhere it said so). So after some watching, I went outside and waited for the shaved ones to come out and shoot them. This worked out very fine, and the people were mostly eager to be photographed. Then, someone asked me to give his photo to him. I did bring a portable printer with me this time, but so far I hadn't used it. So I thought this is the opportunity. I printed his photo and gave it to him, and this made a huge excitement in the crowd! Now everyone wanted his photo taken and printed. I knew I can only print around 12 photos, before the battery goes down, so I tried to be selective. Nevertheless, there were these gangs of young lads who wanted their photo taken, and they wouldn't let me go. I told them they are not cute enough to be photographed, but they didn't care. Anyways, this excitement among the crowd allowed me get back in, and this time, those young lads persuaded the barbers to let me photograph them. Finally, they started to give up one by one, and I started shooting like crazy. It was so much fun. There was a lot to be phrographed and I didn't spare one! It was again proven to me that the most memorable and photographically-prolific places for me are the ones that are off the map!<br />After that frenzy of photography in the Samayapuram Temple, I went back to Trichy to take my train to Chennai in the evening. My next stop was Mamallapuram, a village close to the big city of Chennai.<p>Side notes:<p>- Mosquitoes here do not even care to look for uncovered areas! They bite you through whatever clothes you're wearing!<br />- On the upside, it is sunny and 24 C here everyday! Love it!
