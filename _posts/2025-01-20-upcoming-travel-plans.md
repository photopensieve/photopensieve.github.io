![](/img/Map-world.jpg)

It’s been over six months since we returned from our [epic round-the-world trip](https://photopensieve.github.io/2024/10/11/around-world-in-nine-months.html), and now it’s time to plan our next adventure! This time, we’re combining a family visit with travel through the Middle East and Europe.

Our journey will begin in Paris, followed by a most-awaited trip to **Egypt** and **Jordan**. We will then visit UAE, before heading to Iran to spend some quality time with family. While the rest of the trip isn’t fully finalized yet, we’re hoping to explore more of Europe afterward. Stay tuned for updates!
