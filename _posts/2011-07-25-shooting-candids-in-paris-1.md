# Shooting candids in Paris - 1

Paris is the mecca of photography. So many photographers have documented the life in Paris that we all know how it looks like even if we haven't visited it before. So that's what I wanted to do; photographing parisian life.So after a day of sight-seeing I went back to the hotel and as it started to rain, I decided to call it a day and stay there for the rest of the evening. But then I saw the sun setting down with a clear blue sky, the red neon lights of the shops and cafes, and the glistening streets with rain, I said NOWAY, I have to get out! You know, I love twilight. It's the time when the colors are superb and surreal. I particularly love the twilight in the cities, where you get a mixture of warm and cold colors with a soft light, and no harsh shadows. So I had to head out.I didn't go for the touristic places. I wanted to be somewhere to see the Parisians, the daily life, people coming back home, going out for dinner. So I didn't go far, I stayed around the hotel area, which was far away from the center. But when I came out, I didn't see any opportunities. People were moving so fast and the background was not really picturesque, and I was kind of nervous and feeling like a black sheep! I had to get out of my comfort zone and point my camera at total strangers; something that some people don't like and might even react to it. And this nervousness was not really helping. If the photographer is nervous, he can't see. He won't see the photos. So I put my camera down, taking my time, breathing in the atmosphere and looking. Watching. As I became gradually acclimatized, I gained my confidence. I became a local. And only then, I could see the opportunities.In the beginning, I was shooting with an 85mm lens. Shooting with 85mm has this advantage that you will probably see your subject before he/she sees you. You have to train your eyes for that, it's not trivial. You have to look for subjects at 150mm range, and let them get close to 85mm range. That's the trick. Meanwhile, you have the time to decide, prepare the camera, frame and shoot, before your subject realizes you did it.So I was staying at an an averagely-sized intersection, and I saw that beautiful cafe with those orange neon lights and the people crossing the street, barely illuminated by the last bits of blue daylight, and that was it. I knew I have a shot waiting there for me!

I was just waiting for that look!

Speaking about technique in candid street photography, you need to be fast. You need to know your camera. You need a fast glass too, and a high ISO. Don't shy off from using ISO3200, use it. It has noise, so what? You need to freeze your subject while he/she is walking. You need high shutter speed. A blurry image hardly appeals to the eyes. Noise can be dealt with later. Oh and last but not least, you need a GOOD autofocus system. My 5D is no slouch, but in low light situation and with moving subjects, it had a hard time nailing the focus down.
