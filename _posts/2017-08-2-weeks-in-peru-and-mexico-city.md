It's been a long time since I have done some serious traveling. I would have loved to go around the world, for at least 3 months, but with the work situation of myself and Fahimeh, it's not really happening. So instead, we've decided to do a 2-week trip to Peru, and squeeze in a short visit to Mexico City on the way back (to be honest, the flights worked out to be a bit cheaper too). This is going to happen soon, so stay tuned!<br />

FAQ</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">
Why Peru?</span></h3><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">
Answer: Of course to visit Machu Picchu and Amazon. Well, also the fact that there is a consulate of Peru in Seattle, so we can get a visa without going to San Francisco!<br />
</span><h3><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">
What is your itinerary?</span></h3>
<div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">
Well, not sure yet. We're gonna arrive in Lima, but I'm thinking of taking another flight immediatelt to Cusco (where Machu Picchu is), and spend a good part of our time there. Maybe a short visit to the Amazon later on, but we're a bit wary of Malaria and Zika situation there, so we'll see. Apparently, the risk is really minimal, but it's not non-existent. And of course, we're gonna have a short stay in Lima, which apparently is a gastronomical capital of South America!</span></div>
<h3><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">
How much would it cost?</span></h3><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">
It's not going to be cheap. Flights are pretty expensive, and Peru is not as cheap as India was. I spent $1000 for a month-long trip, but Peru is going to be two or three times more expensive. I also don't want to roughen it up this time.<br />
</span><h3><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">
Cut to the chase; what photography gear you're gonna bring with you?</span></h3>
<div><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: medium;">
Now we're talking! For India, I had my trusty Canon 5D and three prime lenses with me. This time, I'm gonna go a lot lighter with my Sony NEX-6, and three lenses: Sony 10-18mm, Sigma 30mm 1.4, and Sony 50mm 1.8. The whole things is gonna weigh just above 1 kg, so about half the weight of the previous system. Sure, I'm not gonna get the full-frame goodness, but I'm gonna travel lighter instead! I'm also not going to be as focused on portrait photography this time.</span></div>
