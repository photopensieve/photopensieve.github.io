# News!

So it's official! I will have two photo trips soon. A week long trip to northwest of Iran, visiting beautiful villages, cities and do some landscape photography. The highlights of the trip will be visiting [Masouleh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masouleh), [Tabriz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabriz), [Colored Mountains](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alishokri/3745617489/), and [lake Urmia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Urmia). Very photogenic places and great for landscape photography!

The second destination is one of my dream trips: India! I will be backpacking for the first time in India for a month. I am immensely thrilled about it! Just imagine all the possibilities for photography... people, colors, landscape, architecture and chaotic but live cities. There is so much to see in India that a six month tourist visa is barely enough, let alone a month! So I have to handpick a few places. I still haven't settled down with a plan, but I definitely want to visit Delhi, Agra, Varanasi, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh.

I will be posting about my travel plans, my packing, camera gear that I bring with me and eventually blog about my travel here! So make sure to subscribe to the feed, if you use a RSS reader, or follow me by email (you find them both on the right pane).
