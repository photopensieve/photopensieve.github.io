# Canon 40mm f2.8 vs Voigtlander 40mm f2.0: A Quick Comparison

*This was originally posted on Blogger [here](https://photopensieve.blogspot.com/2012/06/canon-40mm-f28-vs-voigtlander-40mm-f20.html)*.

Introduction

The very newly announced Canon 40mm F2.8 piqued my interest, as I do happen to own the formidable Voigtlander 40mm F2.0. I love this lens, and I get great sharp contrasty photos out of it. However, manual focusing limits the kind of photos I can do with this lens. So I was curious to see how the Canon performs compared to the Voigtlander. Here's an academy-style quick comparison of the two lenses.

Materials and Methods

Hardware

All shots are done using a Canon 5D, mounted on a Benro C0691, using mirror lock-up and cable release.

Post-processing

All shots are done in RAW, and converted to JPG in LR 3.5 using the default setting. NO EXTRA SHARPENING is applied. However, note that LR adds a 25 point sharpening by default.

Results and Discussions

General observations

- The Canon considerably vignettes at f2.8. Voigtlander also vignettes at f2.0, but at f2.8 it's almost gone.

- Interestingly, the Canon is a bit "wider" than the Voigtlander, despite the same nominal focal lengths.

- Built quality of the Canon is quite decent, but the Voigtlander's is exceptional.

- Manual focusing using the Voigtlander is a joy. But with the Canon, it's kind of strange. You DON'T need to change the switch, and you can override the autofocus. But the "feel" of focusing is very different and new to me. I'm not sure if it focuses "by wire". Anyways, if you look for manual focusing, the Voigtlander is the way to go.

- The Canon produces a slight noise while focusing. It is very quite though, and it can only be heard if you approach it to your ear. In the field, you never notice. It's much quieter than the Canon 35mm F2.0, for instance.

- The Canon seem to be more contrasty than the Voigtlander, and it has a certain punch to it.

- The Canon focuses closer than the Voigtlander (30 cm vs 38 cm).

- The Canon and the Voigtlander are priced at $199 and $499, respectively.

- What I like about the Voigtlander is the included weird-shaped lens hood, that doubles up as a very good protection of the front element. I also like the old school depth of field indicator on the Voigtlander. It comes very handy.

- I did not compare the Bokeh of the two lenses extensively, but from what I saw in a couple of shots, nothing was wrong with the Canon.

- Both lenses are really compact, but the Canon is a bit shorter

Flare

- Both lenses perform very well with regard to flare, i.e. they don't really flare. If you force them to flare, the Voigtlander shows a bit of flare. But the Canon is astoundingly flare-free, and it even preserves the contrast.

Sharpness

The pictures are 100% crops of [original images](http://www.flickr.com/photos/8413680@N08/7433990340/).

Voigtlander @ f2.0 - It's a bit soft and has a bit of comma, but the result is consistent from corner to corner. Slight chromatic aberration is visible at contrasty edges.

Both lenses in the center @ f2.8 - Sharpness of the Voigtlander is significantly improved. Canon produces very sharp images right off its largest aperture. It's difficult to say which is sharper. I call it a tie. Both lenses show a small amount of chromatic aberration.

Both lenses in the center @ f4.0 - Not much difference in sharpness, compared to f2.8, and between lenses. Chromatic aberration is reduced.

Both lenses in the center @ f5.6 - The Canon reaches an excellent sharpness, and is clearly sharper than the Voigtlander. But we are splitting hair here.

Both lenses in the center @ f8.0 - The Voigtlander reaches the excellent sharpness, and both lenses are almost equally sharp now. If we split molecules here, the Canon might be a tad sharper, but this might be because of larger field of view.

Both lenses in the corner @ f2.8 - Sharpness of the Voigtlander is not improved over f2.0. Both lenses show comma, but they are very sharp. The Canon is a tad sharper.

Both lenses in the corner @ f4.0 - Both lenses get a bit sharper compared to f2.8, but the Canon still has an edge.

Both lenses in the corner @ f5.6 - Sharpness is clearly improved, and both lenses reach excellent sharpness.

Both lenses in the corner @ f8.0 - Not much of difference between lenses, and compared to f5.6.

Conclusion

Canon 40mm F2.8 was a big surprise to me (no pun intended). I did not expect that it beats the sharpness of already excellent Voigtlander 40mm F2.0, but it did. It also showed more resistance to flare. However, we are splitting hair here, and both lenses are very sharp and flare-resistant for any real life application. The canon is a lot cheaper than the Voigtlander, but its built quality is not in the same league as the Voigtlander's. Although the Canon is built very well, and at least considerably better than the 50mm F1.8 and 35mm F2.0. The only shortcoming that I can see with the Canon is that it does not focus fast, like the Canon 85mm f1.8, for example. But if you compare the autofocus speed on the Canon with "your" manual focus speed with the Voigtlander, it's a no-brainer. I also wish Canon would have gone with F2.0 instead of F2.8. It would probably be slightly more expensive and bigger, but it would make it a more compelling option.

So all in all, if you need f2.0, shallower depth of field, love the metallic lenses, and are ok with focusing manually, the Voigtlander is the choice. Otherwise, the Canon is a tiny bit Sharper (specifically in the corner, wide open), more resistant to flare, punchier, slightly wider, considerably cheaper and lighter, and it does AUTOFOCUS. As for me, I will only keep one of them, but which, I still don't know!

What's the next step for Canon? To announce a "smaller" affordable FF camera to go with the 40mm lens! Like the 60D form factor. At least, that's my wish! Come on Canon, you know you can do it! FF cameras don't need to be big.
