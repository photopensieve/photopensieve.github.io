# My Holy Trinity Of Lenses!

I love fast, small, prime lenses, and I finally assembled my dream holy trinity! Here they are:

- Samyang/Rokinon 18mm F2.8
- Sony 35mm F1.8
- Sony 85mm F1.8

This combo allows me to do anything from landscape and cityscape photography to street and portrait photography. Coupled with high megapixel [Sony A7RII](https://photopensieve.blogspot.com/2018/09/gear-update.html) (at 42 MP) that allows me to get usable crop photos, I get a range of 18-130mm!

Sony 35mm and 85mm lenses are of the highest optical and mechanical qualities. Samyang 18mm is so lightweight that the A7RII feels back-heavy, and stopped down to F4.0, it becomes as sharp as the Sony 16-35mm F4.0 lens.

I carry this combo in a [Peak Design Everyday Sling 5L](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-sling-5) that is plenty large, and it allows for optimal access while walking around. I specifically like how you can tighten it, and carry it on the small of your back.

I'm also thinking that depending on the type of trip, and whether I need the 1.8 on the 35mm lens, I can swap it with a Samyang 35mm F2.8 lens that is 200 gr lighter than the sony lens (at a mere 80 gr!). I just wish that Samyang/Rokinon comes up with a feather-weight 70~90mm F2.8 prime lens. That would be fantastic!
