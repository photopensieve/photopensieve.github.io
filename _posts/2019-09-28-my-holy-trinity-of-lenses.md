I love fast, small, prime lenses, and I finally assembled my dream holy trinity! Here they are:<br />
<br />
- Samyang/Rokinon 18mm F2.8<br />
- Sony 35mm F1.8<br />
- Sony 85mm F1.8<br />
<br />
This combo allows me to do anything from landscape and cityscape photography to street and portrait photography. Coupled with high megapixel <a href="https://photopensieve.blogspot.com/2018/09/gear-update.html" target="_blank">Sony A7RII</a>&nbsp;(at 42 MP) that allows me to&nbsp;get usable crop photos, I get a range of 18-130mm!<br />
<br />
Sony 35mm and 85mm lenses are of the highest optical and mechanical qualities. Samyang 18mm is so lightweight that the A7RII feels back-heavy, and stopped down to F4.0, it becomes as sharp as the Sony 16-35mm F4.0 lens.<br />
<br />
I carry this combo in a <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-sling-5" target="_blank">Peak Design Everyday Sling 5L</a> that is plenty large, and it allows for optimal access while walking around. I specifically like how you can tighten it, and carry it on the small of your back.<br />
<br />
I'm also thinking that depending on the type of trip, and whether I need the 1.8 on the 35mm lens, I can swap it with a Samyang 35mm F2.8 lens that is 200 gr lighter than the sony lens (at a mere 80 gr!). I just wish that Samyang/Rokinon comes up with a feather-weight 70~90mm F2.8 prime lens. That would be fantastic!<br /></span>
