Our trip round-the-world trip took us from Europe to the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and ended in Oceania and some of the Pacific Islands. We spent almost a month in Australia and New Zealand, where we went on two road trips. In Australia, we tried "vanlife" for the first time, and it was a blast!

# Australia

I usually start introducing a country by delving into its history, but for Australia, I will focus on its geology, as it is the primary reason behind its distinct flora and fauna. It’s a fascinating topic, and I can’t even scratch the surface here. But shortly, about 300 million years ago, all the continents were connected, forming a supercontinent called Pangea (there were other supercontinent formations in the past, but that’s irrelevant here). Due to the movements of plate tectonics, they started separating again, and Australia, which was initially bordering Antarctica, began its separation into its own continent around 50 million years ago. Australia drifted away and started getting closer to Asia, which brings us to the present day.

Now, let’s look at animal life on the same time scale: dinosaurs went mostly extinct around 66 million years ago (and the remaining ones evolved into birds as we know them today), and mammals started evolving significantly around 200 million years ago. Since Australia separated from other continents around the same time scale, the evolution of mammals (as well as other animals and plants) in Australia continued independently, leading to its unique flora and fauna. That’s how we get animals like the platypus or echidnas in Australia that are in their own family tree with very few species left.

Notably, Australia is home to many marsupials, such as kangaroos and koalas, while the only marsupial outside Australia is the possum, found in North America (we had one in our yard once!). This geological separation has led to the evolution of remarkable animals like the platypus, which baffled scientists at the time, so much that they initially thought it was a prank. Encountering unique plant and animal species in Australia was one of the highlights of our visit.

## Sydney

Our Aussie adventure began in Sydney, where, by coincidence, my cousin and his wife were also visiting for work from Canada, and we planned our visit so we can spend some time together. We arrived in Australia during the autumn, so the weather in Sydney was unpredictable, with occasional rain, but overall it was pleasant. Sydney's public transportation was top-notch, clearly designed to make the city very livable. We visited Sydney Zoo and enjoyed seeing rare Australian wildlife up close, including echidnas, platypuses, koalas, and kangaroos. The iconic Sydney Opera House was, of course, the main photography attraction, and I tried shooting it from different angles. Overall, I would say Sydney is a great city to live in, but there is not much to see as a tourist, so a few days is enough to see its main attractions.

## Vanlife in Sunshine Coast

After spending about a week in Sydney, we flew to Brisbane, where we spent a couple of days exploring the city before picking up our van rental for 9 days. The main highlight of our Australian trip was a road trip along the Sunshine Coast in a campervan. We had never tried sleeping in a van before, so we seized this opportunity to experience it for the first time, and see for ourselves what the whole buzz is about. We camped at five different locations along the Sunshine Coast, all of which were fully equipped with toilets, showers, and kitchens, so we were not roughing it by any means. The convenience of the campervan setup was one of the things we loved most; setting up and breaking camp was as simple as parking the van, opening the back, pulling out the kitchen slider and drawers, and setting up the table and chairs. Driving a large van on the left side of the road was whole other story, which I will get to soon.

Our campervan was a 19-foot Toyota Commuter which we had rented through “Camplify”. It had a semi-tall ceiling, so I could almost fully stand inside, but not quite, making me realize the importance of being able to fully stand in a van during extended trips. The van seated four people with proper seat belts - which is rare in most campervans - allowing us to use a child car seat. Inside, there was a full bed on an elevated platform. While the permanent bed took up a lot of space, it was convenient as we could jump right in without any setup. The bed was quite tight for the three of us, and it was a bit of a challenge to get a good night sleep. One of the great things about having a campervan was that we could all snuggle inside, when it was rainy outside, and we didn’t have to endure bad weather outside. Our son turned the bed into his playroom, where he spent hours playing with his Legos and toys!

The back gate of the van opened up, revealing numerous drawers for ample storage, including a propane stove top on one of the drawers for cooking. Having the kitchen set up outside has its pros and cons; I preferred it this way as it kept cooking smells out and optimized the interior space. The van lacked external fans, causing some condensation despite leaving the windows slightly open at night. It also had a pull-out top-loading fridge inside, which was inconvenient—I would have preferred it set up in the back for better access, even if it meant less storage space. The inline shore power was useful for powering 220v devices at campsites, though it would have been better if it powered an A/C or heater, especially in extreme conditions. Lastly, the van had an awning, but it was a bit too flimsy to use. I like having an awning, but it should be more sturdy.

Overall, I think this was a functional setup, and it was good for short trips. However, doing this trip, I realized how uncomfortable “vanlife” is. The confined quarters can make it difficult to manage the needs of a young child, such as playtime, napping, and feeding, without feeling cramped. Additionally, having have to use shared outside bathroom, and kitchen facilities wasn’t quite comfortable, but perfectly doable for a short period of time. Furthermore, the lack of storage space for essentials, toys, and clothing can create a cluttered environment, making it hard to keep the van organized and functional for the entire family. Nonetheless, traveling by a campervan in Australia was a fantastic experience, and one of the highlights of our trip so far.


## Driving on the “wrong” side of the road

I've visited many countries where driving is on the left side of the road, but I never dared to drive there—it seemed too risky. One mistake could put you on the wrong side of the road and lead to a crash. However, I decided to give it a try in Australia, where drivers are generally good and the roads aren't congested.

Adding to the challenge, I was driving a 19-foot van for the first time. But two things helped: 1) We had spent almost two months in left-side driving countries like Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Australia before this trip, so I was somewhat accustomed to it, 2) my wife was beside me, staying as vigilant as I was and constantly reminding me to do the right thing.

Initially, driving the van required a lot of mental energy, but I quickly got the hang of it, and after a few days, it felt almost normal. However, two things took much longer to adapt to: 1) As a driver, I am used to keeping the car more on the left side inside the lane, or in another word, aligning my side with the left side of the lane. Driving on the other side of the road meant that unconsciously, I would steer to left inside a lane, hence crossing the left line. I had to consciously remind myself to stay on the right side of the lane. This adjustment took some time, but I eventually got the hang of it, 2) the turn signal and windshield wiper switches were swapped, and I never fully got used to it. I often hit the wiper switch instead of the turn signal. Funnily enough, when I started driving on the right side again, I was mixing it for a few days!


## Sunshine Coast

The Sunshine Coast is a coastal region north of Brisbane, encompassing towns and cities such as Caloundra, Maroochydore, Noosa, and Mooloolaba. Known for its beaches, hinterland, and relaxed lifestyle, the Sunshine Coast is a popular destination for visitors.

We spent a few nights near Caloundra, enjoying walks along the golden coast and watching the stereotypical Aussies surfboarding in droves. It was especially cute to see them teaching their little kids to surf. Our journey then took us to Noosa, where we spent most of our time. We particularly enjoyed Noosa North Shore, a secluded area with a wide sandy stretch about 50 km long, mostly empty with occasional 4WD vehicles roaming around in designated areas in a distance. The resident kangaroos were a highlight, though we kept our distance from the large males, who can be aggressive. Noosa National Park was another favorite, offering stunning views over the expansive sandy beaches.

Australia is one of the best destinations in the world for camping and overlanding, and for a good reason. We had an amazing time visiting, and I’m sure we will come back to visit more of Australia in the future. Overall, I really enjoyed the quality of life in Australia, and I think it is one of the best places to live in the world.

# New Zealand

As the seasons are reversed in the southern hemisphere, our travel in end of May was during the fall season in New Zealand, hence cooler weathers. Since we were not prepared for cold weather travel (and my wife is not a big fan of cold weather anyways), we decided to only stick with the North Island, where the weather was quite a bit warmer than the South Island. We spent a week doing a short road trip, but we know we have to come back for more!

## Geology and Geography of New Zealand

Just like Australia, let’s first start by discussing the geography and geology of New Zealand, and I will touch upon its history briefly as well. New Zealand's geological history is marked by its separation from the supercontinent Gondwana around 85 million years ago. This event set it adrift in the Pacific Ocean, allowing its landmasses to evolve in relative isolation. Over millions of years, tectonic activity shaped its rugged landscapes, creating mountain ranges, volcanic activity, and deep fjords. The North and South Islands were formed through a combination of volcanic eruptions and tectonic shifts, contributing to the diverse topography seen today.

This prolonged isolation led to the development of unique wildlife, with many species evolving independently from those on other continents. New Zealand is renowned for its flightless birds, like the kiwi, which became emblematic of the country's natural heritage. The absence of land mammals (which probably never got a chance to evolve there) allowed birds and insects to dominate the ecosystem. This evolutionary path also gave rise to distinctive reptiles, such as the tuatara, and a variety of plant species found nowhere else on Earth.

Today, New Zealand's geography is characterized by its dramatic landscapes, ranging from the sandy beaches and rolling farmlands of the North Island to the towering Southern Alps and glacial valleys of the South Island. The country's terrain includes active volcanoes, geothermal areas, and extensive forested regions, providing a rich tapestry of natural beauty. This varied geography supports a wide range of ecosystems and outdoor activities, making New Zealand a destination renowned for its scenic diversity and environmental conservation efforts.


## History Of New Zealand

The Maori, indigenous to New Zealand, migrated from other South Pacific islands in the 13th century, distinguishing their culture with intricate art, strong tribal systems, and a profound bond with the land. They share similarities with Pacific Islanders like Fijians and Hawaiians, stemming from their Polynesian origins. More on that in the next blog post!

Maori’s way of life, however, changed dramatically with the arrival of British settlers in the early 19th century. British colonization led to conflicts and the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, which guaranteed Maori rights to their land and resources. However, misunderstandings and breaches of the treaty by the British government led to land confiscations, loss of cultural autonomy, and social upheaval among the Maori. Today, the Maori people have undergone a cultural renaissance, reclaiming their language, traditions, and political voice. Maori is the national language along with English, and Maori people play a significant role in New Zealand's society, with representation in government, education, and the arts.

## One week road trip in New Zealand

We had three main highlights during out short, one-week trip to the North Island.

**Hobbiton** is the set where the scenes of Shire in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit movies were shot. For LOTR, they built this place, made the shots, and then razed it down. But for The Hobbit movies, they built it to last, so that it becomes a tourists attraction. Visiting Hobbiton feels like stepping right into the world of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, though it is clearly a well-kept movie set. For a fan like me, this was so amazing. The rolling green hills, the cozy hobbit holes with their colorful doors, and the charming little gardens all look exactly like they do in the movies. As you wander around, you remember the scenes where hobbits walked around and celebrated, and the guide tells many stories of how it all happened on the movie set, and in the books.

We booked our tickets in advance, but it wasn’t too necessary, since it was practically the low season. Nonetheless, it was a bit crowded, so I can’t imagine how packed it is during high season. The drive to and from the Hobbiton was every bit as magical, with all the green rolling hills, sheep and cattle grazing around, and occasional rainbows. Even if you’re not a LOTR fan, visiting Hobbiton is a must-do activity in the North Island.

Our next destination was **Rotorua**, which is famous for its hot springs, and Maori culture. It is like a mini Yellowstone National Park, where you see bubbling mud pools, steaming geysers, and hot springs, which emit a distinctive aroma of sulphur throughout the town. You even see hot springs in parks around the town, and even in people’s backyards! Beyond its geothermal attractions, Rotorua offers rich insights into Maori heritage, with traditional performances, arts, and crafts showcasing centuries-old traditions, but we didn’t find the time to visit, which was a miss. But walking around the town, you see many Maori people living their fully modern daily life, wearing their distinct facial tattoos.

Our last stop was **Waitomo Glowworm Caves**, which is also a must-visit location in North Island. The caves present a mesmerizing underground world illuminated by thousands of tiny bioluminescent worms. The worms glow in the dark to attract bugs, and capture them with a sticky slimy thread. Our guide was a very friendly and funny Maori guy with a thick New Zealand accent that constantly reminded me of Korg, the beloved rock-like giant in Marvel Cinematic Universe. The highlight of the visit was drifting silently through the pitch dark caverns by a boat, and witnessing a spectacle of blue-green lights twinkling like stars in the darkness above. These glowworms, unique to New Zealand, create an otherworldly ambiance that feels both enchanting and surreal. I was initially pretty bummed out that we can’t take a photo or video in there, but when we got in the cavern, but I quickly realized that in that sheer darkness, there is no way to take photos anyways, and people trying that will inevitably result in firing flashes that will destroy the mood for everyone (and stupid photos with no glowworm visible anyways). The only way to take photos is to be stationary with a tripod, and use long exposure. Even that may not be enough, so some sort of artificial lighting might be necessary. They do offer taking a photo of you in front of a green screen outside the cave, and photoshopping the scene behind you, but you can do that at home anyways. Nevertheless, the experience of watching those glowworms twinkling above was certainly magical, and a highlight of our New Zealand trip.

# FAQ

## How similar are Australia and New Zealand?

From an outside perspective, New Zealand and Australia may appear quite similar due to their geographical proximity and shared colonial history. Both countries were settled by the British, and English is the dominant language, shaping their cultural and social frameworks. However, upon visiting, the differences between the two become strikingly apparent. Australia's vast, arid landscapes, iconic outback, and unique fauna like kangaroos and koalas contrast sharply with New Zealand's lush, green countryside, dramatic fjords, and predominantly avian wildlife with no marsupials. The indigenous cultures also differ significantly; Australia is home to the ancient traditions of Aboriginal peoples, while New Zealand proudly showcases the rich heritage of the Māori. Even the climate varies greatly, with Australia experiencing a much hotter and more arid climate compared to New Zealand's temperate and maritime weather. These distinctions underscore that, beyond the superficial similarities of language and some cultural practices, New Zealand and Australia are worlds apart in their natural environments, indigenous cultures, and overall way of life.

From our perspectives as visitors, we saw a striking difference between the people too. In Australia, you mainly see the descendants of British settlers, as well as some newer immigrants like Indians and Asians, but you may not see any descendants of the aboriginals. In New Zealand, however, you see a large minority of Maōri along with the White population, and they seem to co-mingle pretty well (though this is based on limited observations). I naturally asked myself why there is such a big difference between the demographics, and this discussion on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1901et9/how_is_it_that_indigenous_maori_culture_is_much/) answered it quite well.
